## Screening microbial population un bioreactors for energy generation and water desalination

Bioelectrochemical systems are emerging as a promising and friendly alternative to convert the energy stored in wastewater directly into electricity by microorganisms and utilize it in situ to drive desalination. 
To better understand such processes, we had developed an anoxic biocathode microbial desalination cell for the conversion of carbon- and nitrogen-rich wastewaters into bioenergy and to perform salt removal. 

In this repository, we present the analysis of the microbial diversity developed in the anode and cathode chambers of a microbial desalination cell bioreactor.
